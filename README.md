# How it works

- The current day and date should be displayed at the top of the page
- There should be different time blocks displayed for every business hour of that day
- Each of these timeblocks should be color coded depending on wether it's in the past (grey), present(red), or future(green).
- When you click into a time block, you can enter an event 
- This event should persist when you refresh the page
